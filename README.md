# Table Statistics

This mini-app allows you to view your workspace datasets and a selection of summary statistics about each variable within. Each variable can be displayed as a histogram, showing the distribution of the data.

1. The first tab contains the application output. This shows a summary of each variable, its type, the number of missing values, and basic       statistics. 
2. This second Help tab gives you an overview of the mini-app itself and how to use it.
